# T5UIC1
## 1 Overview
The T5UIC1 is a UART based screen based on the DWIN T5 CPU. The T5UIC1 only has a single T5 CPU core and uses a unique reduced instruction set. It is best suited for low-cost applications that do not require a touchscreen or complex UI functions.

* 384kb storage for fonts
    * 6x12 to 32x64 dot matrix ASCII characters and 12x12 to 64x64 dot matrix GB2312 character library
* 512kb storage for images and icons. (Divided into 16 banks of 32kb. Single image cannot exceed 32kb)
    * Divided into 16 banks of 32kb.
    * Can store 16 JPEG images, not exceeding 32kb each.
    * Can store up to 16 JPEG icon library files. (A single library file can occupy multiple banks)
* 32kb of SRAM, for user specified data.
    * Can be read and written to during runtime. Initialized to `0` on boot.
    * Useful for uploading new pictures during runtime.
* 16kb flash memory, for user specified data.
    * Can be read and written to during runtime. Contents persist between reboots.
    * 100,000 write cycles.
    * Useful for persistent configuration options.
* MicroSD/SDHC slot for firmware, fonts & image updates.
* An additional full-duplex serial port that can be controlled through UART.
    * Useful for daisy chaining peripherals to the display on processors with a single UART line.
* Adjustable CPU clock (240MHz and 400MHz)

## 2 UART instruction set
The device has a configurable baud-rate. The baud-rate is configured through the SD card config file `T5UIC1.CFG`.

The serial port is always in **8N1** mode.

### 2.1 Color format
All colors are in the 16 bit **RGB565** format.
**16 Bits:**
| 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9  | 8  | 7  | 6  | 5  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 1  | 0  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| R4 | R3 | R2 | R1 | R0 | G5 | G4 | G3 | G2 | G1 | G0 | B4 | B3 | B2 | B1 | B0 |

### 2.2 Coordinate system
Coordinate system is controlled by the rotation parameter in the SD card config file `T5UIC1.CFG`

![Coordinate system](coordinates.png)

### 2.3 Display buffers
The device has a main framebuffer (that's directly drawn on the screen) and 2 virtual screen buffers. The virtual screen buffers serve for background transparency and spritesheet functions.

Virtual screen buffer #0 is always set to the currently displayed background image and is mainly used for transparent image operations by background redraw.

Virtual screen buffer #1 must be set manually and is mainly used for selecting areas from the loaded image and drawing them on to the main framebuffer (for example a spritesheet)

### 2.4 Serial data frame
A single data frame to the display consists of a frame header, instruction, data, CRC (optional) and footer.

The data frame is as such:
| Header | Instruction        | Data                    | CRC (optional) | Footer              |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| `0xAA`   | 1 byte instruction | Up to 248 bytes of data | 2 byte CRC-16/MODBUS | `0xCC 0x33 0xC3 0x3C` |

### 2.5 CRC
CRC can be enabled in the SD card config file `T5UIC1.CFG`. The CRC is a CRC-16/MODBUS.

If any instruction fails the CRC check the device will return the following error:

| Instruction | Data |
|-------------|------|
| `0xFF`      | `0x01`|

All device responses will also generate their own CRC.

### 2.6 Instruction set
Below are all the instructions and their corresponding parameters. Every instruction follow the format described in **Serial Data Frame**. If an instruction has an expected response it is **explicitly listed**. All instructions without an expected response described, do not have any response.

## 3 SD/SDHC, configuration and firmware
The device firmware and assets are loaded through the SD card interface. This is done by placing files with predefined filenames into a directory named `DWIN_SET` on the root of the SD card. The system will automatically recognize these files and update itself upon power up.

The SD card has a limitation of a maximum size of **16GB**.

It must only contain a **single** partition. 

The partition must be formatted as **FAT32** with **4KB** sector size.


**NEVER INSERT OR REMOVE THE SD CARD WHILE THE DEVICE IS POWERED UP! DOING SO WILL DAMAGE THE DEVICE!**

When the device begins a firmware upgrade the screen will blank blue. When the device is done upgrading the screen will blank orange/red. When that happens, it is safe to power the device off. **POWERING OFF THE DEVICE DURING A FIRMWARE UPGRADE (BLUE SCREEN) CAN DAMAGE THE DEVICE!**

### 3.1 Description of firmware files
Not all files in this section are mandatory. One can only flash specific files without having all of them preset, for example only the font library. All files listed below **must** be placed within a folder named `DWIN_SET` in the root of the SD card in order for the device to discover them.

| Filename     | Usage                                                                                |

|[0-15]\*.ICO  |Icon library file to load into the memory bank denoted by its numeric prefix          |

### 3.2 Config file format (T5UIC1.CFG)
This file contains the hardware configuration for the DWIN board, for example baud rate and default screen rotation.
